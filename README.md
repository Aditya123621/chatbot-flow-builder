## ðŸ§© Features

### âœ… Message Node (Text)

- You can drag and drop as many **message nodes** as you want.
- Each node shows a message and a WhatsApp icon.
- You can click a node to edit its message.

### âœ… Flow Builder with React Flow

- Uses [React Flow](https://reactflow.dev/) to create the flow.
- Nodes can be connected using edges.
- A node can have **only one outgoing edge**.
- A node can have **multiple incoming edges**.

### âœ… Settings Panel

- When a node is selected, you can edit the message in the right panel.
- It uses **debounce** (from lodash) to avoid updating too fast.

### âœ… Nodes Panel

- When no node is selected, the panel on the right lets you **drag and drop** new message nodes.
- This is built in a way to support **adding more types of nodes later**.

### âœ… Save Flow

- There is a "Save changes" button at the top.
- When clicked:
  - If there are more than one nodes, and more than one of them have **no incoming connection**, it shows an error.
  - Otherwise, it shows a success toast.
